# Restaurant Page - The Odin Project Series.

## Overview

In this project we will primarily be exploring the current state of Javascript with how package management, bundling is done. This project focuses primarily on a module bundler, called webpack. We will also use ES6 based imports and exports to render our pages, styles,images and also implement a really simple tab switch functionalilty within the restaurant page.
